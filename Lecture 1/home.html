        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <h3>Level 1: Knowledge and Comprehension</h3>
        <p>Level 1 outcomes are those in which the student has been exposed to the terms and concepts at a basic level and can supply basic definitions. The material has been presented only at a superficial level.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1a. Describe implications of Church-Turing thesis.</li>
            <li>1b. Describe problems for which an algorithm exists, and problems for which there are no algorithms (non-recursive, non-recursively enumerable languages) and describe the implications of such results.</li>
            <li>1c. Describe and explain the diagonalization process as used in proofs about computability.</li>
            <li>1d. Describe the difference between feasible and non-feasible algorithms, describe the limitations of the current formalization of feasibility as polynomial-time.</li>
            <li>1e. Describe the main ideas behind the concepts of NP and NP-hardness, know examples of NP-hard problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 2: Application and Analysis</h3>
        <p>Level 2 outcomes are those in which the student can apply the material in familiar situations, e.g., can work a problem of familiar structure with minor changes in the details.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2a. Convert a non-deterministic finite automaton into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton.</li>
            <li>2b. Convert a non-deterministic finite automaton into an equivalent regular expression.</li>
            <li>2c. Convert a regular expression into an equivalent finite automaton.</li>
            <li>2d. Construct a regular expression for a regular language.</li>
            <li>2e. Convert a context-free grammar into an equivalent pushdown automaton.</li>
            <li>2f. Construct a context-free grammar for a given context-free language.</li>
            <li>2g. Design an algorithm for a machine model to simulate another model.</li>
            <li>2h. Build simple Turing machines.</li>
            <li>2i. Prove formally properties of languages or computational models.</li>
            <li>2j. Apply a parsing algorithm.</li>
            <li>2k. Build a parse tree or a derivation from a context-free grammar.</li>
            <li>2l. Use the closure properties in arguments about languages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 3: Synthesis and Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Level 3 outcomes are those in which the student can apply the material in new situations. This is the highest level of mastery.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3a. Compare regular, context-free, recursive, and recursively enumerable languages.</li>
            <li>3b. Compare finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines.</li>
        </ul>
