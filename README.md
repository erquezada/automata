## Course Objectives

This course covers theoretical computing models and the formal languages they characterize, including finite state machines, regular expressions, pushdown automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, and computability. It explores the capabilities and limitations of each model and their applications, such as lexical analysis and parsing.

## Major Topics Covered in the Course

- Regular languages, finite automata (FA), non-deterministic FA (NFA)
- Context-free languages, pushdown automata (PDA)
- Parsing, normal forms, ambiguity
- Pumping lemmas and closure properties
- Turing machines and other equivalent models
- Decidable languages, non-decidable languages, recognizable languages, Chomsky hierarchy

## Learning Outcomes

### Level 1: Knowledge and Comprehension

- Describe implications of Church-Turing thesis.
- Describe problems for which an algorithm exists and problems for which there are no algorithms (non-recursive, non-recursively enumerable languages) and describe the implications of such results.
- Describe and explain the diagonalization process as used in proofs about computability.
- Describe the difference between feasible and non-feasible algorithms, describe the limitations of the current formalization of feasibility as polynomial-time.
- Describe the main ideas behind the concepts of NP and NP-hardness, know examples of NP-hard problems.

### Level 2: Application and Analysis

- Convert a non-deterministic finite automaton into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton.
- Convert a non-deterministic finite automaton into an equivalent regular expression.
- Convert a regular expression into an equivalent finite automaton.
- Construct a regular expression for a regular language.
- Convert a context-free grammar into an equivalent pushdown automaton.
- Construct a context-free grammar for a given context-free language.
- Design an algorithm for a machine model to simulate another model.
- Build simple Turing machines.
- Prove formally properties of languages or computational models.
- Apply a parsing algorithm.
- Build a parse tree or a derivation from a context-free grammar.
- Use the closure properties in arguments about languages.

### Level 3: Synthesis and Evaluation

- Compare regular, context-free, recursive, and recursively enumerable languages.
- Compare finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines.
